### 문제 설명

<p>Nicholas Neverson was a student at Northlings Neverland Academy. As with any daydreaming student, Nicholas was playing around with a Kaleidoscope one day instead of paying attention to the teacher. Since this was math class, his daydreams quickly turned to palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is any number which reads the same forwards and backwards.</p>

<p>He describes his vision to you at lunch: numbers which are palindromic in several bases at once. Nicholas wonders how many such numbers exist. You decide you can quickly code up a program that given a range and a number k, outputs the number of numbers palindromic in all bases j, 2 ≤ j ≤ k, in that range.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of three space-separated integers: a, b, and k. The input satisfies the following constraints:</p>

<ul>
	<li>0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 2 000 000,</li>
	<li>2 ≤ k ≤ 100 000.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the quantity of numbers between a and b inclusive which are palindromes in every base j, for 2 ≤ j ≤ k.</p>
