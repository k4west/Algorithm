### 문제 설명

<p>These days one may get hundreds of email messages a day. Of course, nobody can read so many of them. Thus Juku wants to highlight messages whose senders are in his contact list.</p>

<p>Write a program that gets Juku's contact list and the senders of his email messages and counts, how many of those messages should be highlighted.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains $N$, the number of entries in Juku's contact list ($1 \le N \le 1\,000$), and each of the following $N$ lines one email address of 1 to 50 characters.</p>

<p>The next line of the file contains $M$, the number of messages ($1 \le M \le 10\,000$), and each of the following $M$ lines the sender address of one message, again 1 to 50 characters.</p>

<p>The characters in an email address can be lower-case letters (<code>a</code>$\dots$<code>z</code>), digits (<code>0</code>$\dots$<code>9</code>), dots (<code>.</code>) and at-signs (<code>@</code>).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The only line of output should contain one integer: the number of messages to be highlighted.</p>
