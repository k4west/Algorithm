### 문제 설명

<p>One lovely afternoon, Bessie's friend Heidi was helping Bessie review for her upcoming math exam.</p>

<p>Heidi presents two integers A (0 <= A <= 45) and B (1 <= B <= 9) to Bessie who must respond with an integer E in the range 1..62. E is the smallest integer in that range that is strictly greater than A and also has B as the first digit of 2 raised to the E-th power. If there is no answer, Bessie responds with 0.</p>

<p>Help Bessie correctly answer all of Heidi's questions by calculating her responses.</p>

<p>By way of example, consider A=1 and B=6. Bessie might generate a table like this:</p>

<pre>         E         2^E    First digit of 2^E
         2          4            4
         3          8            8
         4         16            1
         5         32            3
         6         64            6      <-- matches B</pre>

<p>Thus, E=6 is the proper answer.</p>

<p>NOTE: The value of 2^44 does not fit in a normal 32-bit integer.</p>
