### 문제 설명

<p>Tehran municipality has set up a new charging method for the Congestion Charging Zone (CCZ) which controls the passage of vehicles in Tehran’s high-congestion areas in the congestion period (CP) from 6:30 to 19:00. There are plate detection cameras inside or at the entrances of the CCZ recording vehicles seen at the CCZ. The table below summarizes the new charging method.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width: 60%;">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th style="text-align: center;">The first time seen in the CP</th>
			<th style="text-align: center;">The last time seen in the CP</th>
			<th style="text-align: center;">Charge</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align: center;">6:30 to 10:00</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">6:30 to 16:00</td>
			<td style="text-align: center;">24000</td>
