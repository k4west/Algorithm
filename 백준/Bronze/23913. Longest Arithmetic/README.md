### 문제 설명

<p>An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences between consecutive integers are equal. For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3], and [9, 7, 5, 3] are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are not arithmetic arrays.</p>

<p>Sarasvati has an array of <b>N</b> non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>. She wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray from her array that has the maximum length. Please help her to determine the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic subarray.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <b>T</b>. <b>T</b> test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer <b>N</b>. The second line contains <b>N</b> integers. The i-th integer is <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing <code>Case #x: y</code>, where <code>x</code> is the test case number (starting from 1) and <code>y</code> is the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic subarray.</p>
