### 문제 설명

<p>Little children love to break their toys so much! And little Andrew is no exception, he breaks into fragments everything he sees. This time he is about to break a set of four positive integers.</p>

<p>Let's say that <em>fractification</em> of four integers ($a$, $b$, $c$, $d$) is the sum $$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} $$. Little Andrew doesn't like anything larger that himself, so he wants <em>fractification</em> to be as small as possible.</p>

<p>You were asked to help Andrew in making the <em>fractification</em> of given four integers minimal possible if you are allowed to swap theese integers with each other any way you want.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>In the first and only line of input there are four positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ splitted by space ($ 1 \le a, b, c, d \le 10^9 $).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print four integers which are the permutation of given four, so their <em>fractification</em> is minimal possible. If there are more than one such permutations, print any.</p>
